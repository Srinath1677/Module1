# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```python
men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```
## Output
## ![447269112-99ac6a84-aaba-42a0-9e39-581a7c3b214e](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d17b7e37-7f51-498b-ba5b-6278c0c90238)

## Result
Thus the program is executed successfully.
